    location1Address: String, //easy for yelp
    location1City: String,//easy for yelp
    location1State: String,//easy for yelp
    location1Zip: Number,//easy for yelp
    daysOp: //  This should be included in the information below- or this could be extracted from the info below(but that is reduntant)
