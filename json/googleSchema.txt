-------original schema for yelp with comments-----------------------

var dataFormatGoogle = new Schema({
    orgName: String, // true
    address: String, //true
    phone: String, // true phone
    email: String, //false
    website: String, //true website
    tagLine: String, // false
    logo: String, //flase
    photo: String, //true
    mainCategory: String, // see below
    subCategories: String, // combine this with above category because Google doesnt give a distincion, only "types" key
    top5Services: String,// not provided by yelp
    description: String,// not provided by yelp
    optionalInfo: String,// not provided by yelp
    location1Name: //this will be same as orgName -- redundant
    location1Address: String,// easy for google
    location1City: String,// easy for google
    location1State: String,// easy for google
    location1Zip: Number,// easy for google
    location1Phone: String,// easy for google
    location1Email: // not available through api
    areasServed: // not available through api
    daysOp: //  This should be included in the information below- or this could be extracted from the info below(but that is redundant)
    hoursOp: Object, // this should be formatted the way google or yelp does it in a json object with the hours for each day
    ratings: Number, //Easy
    busType: // not available through api
});

-----------proposed schema based on comments(at least everything that is available from scraping)---------------------

var dataFormatGoogle = new Schema({
    orgName: String, // true
    address: String, //true
    phone: String, // true phone
    website: String, //true website
    photo: String, //true
    mainCategory: String, // see below
    subCategories: String, // combine this with above category because Google doesnt give a distincion, only "types" key
    location1Address: String,// easy for google
    location1City: String,// easy for google
    location1State: String,// easy for google
    location1Zip: Number,// easy for google
    location1Phone: String,// easy for google
    hoursOp: Object, // this should be formatted the way google or yelp does it in a json object with the hours for each day
    ratings: Number, //Easy
});
